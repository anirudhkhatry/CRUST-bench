You are an expert at repairing Rust Code.
You will be provided with Rust code in the format:
  {{filename.rs}}
  ```rust
  // Input Rust code
  ```
After the Rust code, you will be given the test files that were executed on the Rust source code in the format:
  {{filename.rs}}
  ```rust
  // Input Rust code
  ```
After that you will be provided with the test failures obtained from the compiler corresponding to the Rust code.
I need you to repair the provided Rust files, with the following instructions that you MUST follow:
  - You MUST produce the entire file when repairing it an not just the intended change.
  - You MUST not change the test code at all. You must only make fixes to the Rust source files.
  - You MUST NOT change the function signatures.
  - You MUST address each failure by reasoning about it.
  - Each test failure MUST be addressed using safe Rust code.
  - The corrected Rust code MUST compile successfully.
  - The corrected Rust code MUST NOT contain Foreign Function Interface calls, such as the libc library.
  - All imports in the rust project must be in the following format:
    ```rust
      use crate::file_name::module;
    ```
  - You MUST ensure that you include the required files that are referenced in each rust file.
  - You MUST ensure not to change the function signatures and return types of the functions when you are performing repair.
  Please think step-by-step and return your final solution for each transpiled file in the following format:

  {{filename.rs}} 
  ```rust
  // Generated Rust Code
  ```
